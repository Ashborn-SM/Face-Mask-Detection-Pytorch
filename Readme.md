This is a course project i have created using pytorch.
Run the Detector_MTCNN.py. At present video is taken from the
webcam you can change this by changing "cv.VideoCapture(0)".

"Make sure to download the state dict to get the prediction right."

state dict- https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oRBDw_HmqCaQ2jnT4aSZHyYVBi4ELhSt?usp=sharing

I have uploaded few predicted frames, sorry i couldnt save it as a video.

I tried both the models with different video's, ResNet9 and ResNet15 performed well.
I noticed that there are some video ResNet9 performed well but ResNet15 did not and vice-versa.

Try both the models and see whats best.
